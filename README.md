## Natural Language Processing

Essential natural language processing (NLP) tasks include pronunciation modeling, morphology analysis (tokenization and lemmatization), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and syntactic parsing.

### Pronunciation Modeling:
Pronunciation modeling involves representing the phonetic or sound-based aspect of words in a language. This task is essential for applications such as speech synthesis (text-to-speech systems), speech recognition, and language learning tools. A pronunciation dictionary, like the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, maps words to their phonetic representations, enabling algorithms to generate or recognize spoken language.

### Morphology Analysis:
Morphology analysis deals with the structure of words and their component parts, such as prefixes, suffixes, and root forms. It includes tokenization and lemmatization.
- Tokenization: Tokenization is the process of splitting text into smaller units, typically words or subwords, which are called tokens. This is the first step in many NLP tasks.
- Lemmatization: Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or canonical form (lemma). For example, "running" would be lemmatized to "run". This helps in normalizing variations of words.

### Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:
POS tagging involves labeling each word in a sentence with its corresponding part of speech, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. This task is crucial for many NLP applications, including syntactic analysis, information extraction, and machine translation.

### Syntactic Parsing:
Syntactic parsing, also known as parsing or syntax analysis, is the process of analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence to determine its syntactic structure. This involves identifying phrases and their relationships within a sentence, such as subject-verb-object relationships. Syntactic parsing is essential for understanding the meaning of sentences, generating parse trees, and performing deeper semantic analysis.
